// Generate docs/developer/history/commit-index.md from the monorepo git log.

// Run from the REPO ROOT (website/../), not from website/:
//
//   node website/scripts/generate-commit-index.mjs
//
// The index lists the FULL product history from HEAD (non-merge commits,
// newest first) and links every hash to its GitHub permalink:
//
//   https://github.com/rushi-dynmsh/agentgate-dev/commit/<hash>
//
// SELF-REFERENCE LOOP — commits that touch ONLY this generated file are
// EXCLUDED from the index. If the index included them, regenerating it would
// itself create such a commit, which would then appear in the index, forcing
// another regeneration, forever. (Unlike the old developer-docs/-based
// version of this script, this does NOT exclude the whole website/ tree —
// website/ is real product surface now, not just meta-documentation, so
// excluding it wholesale would wrongly scrub genuine feature commits from
// the index. Only the generated output file itself is excluded.)
//
// Links only resolve once the branch is pushed, so the script checks the live
// remote tip and WARNs if HEAD is ahead of it (unpublished commits would 404).
//
// Output is written to website/docs/developer/history/commit-index.md. The
// generated file is committed so the static site reflects the git history at
// generation time; regenerate whenever meaningful commits land. Safe to
// re-run — it overwrites only its own target file.
